For normal map please use texture file - "tmapNormal.bmp".
Sky is just procedural gradients.





DISPLACEMENT MAP

There are three versions of model - low, middle and high poly. However, it's better 
to use attached displace map to generate model from plane object (like in 3ds max version).
In that way you have control on details and polycount (by changing polycount of 
base plane object).
